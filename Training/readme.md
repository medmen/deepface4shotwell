# Training

This folder needs to hold a subfolder for each Person you wantg to train your set on.

## Structure 

So the structure is like

Training  
|  
|- Anton A  
|  
|- Berta B  
|  
|- Cesar C  

## Files

Each subfolder can hold multiple files holding faces of the Person to detect.  
No naming conventions.  
Make sure faces are clearly depicted and the background is not too disturbing. Passport images seem ideal. 
And dont choose too small file size...
