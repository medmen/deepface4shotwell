# Setup
## Prerequisites

1. PYTHON - As this is a python tool, you need python, obviously :wink:. Version 3.x is needed. Ask your local search engine to aid you with installation...
2. SHOTWELL - Shotwell is a personal photo manager made for Linux. This program is adapted to Shotwells organization structure and database layout, 
but it should take little programming effort to port its ideas to other image managers.
3. COFFEE - a drink you should enjoy hot or frozen
4. TERMINAL - this is no GUI program, working at the command line should not fear you :nauseated_face:
5. IMPROVISATION - this document is based on my experience with Ubuntu Linux (20.04 right now), using other OSes will force you to 
adapt!
