# Testing

if you enable testing in config.py, you can monitor which persons this program identifies correctly (or false).  

## How it works

The contents of this folder will be created automatically.  
Each face identified will be placed in a folder named after the person identified.

You can check each folder for false positives. It should be easier than scrolling through the log file. 
See if cou can refine you result by adding false matches to their correct folder ...
